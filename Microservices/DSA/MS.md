Here are 40 Actual Questions (or variations) that appear repeatedly in Microsoft Online Assessments.

I. The "String Manipulation" Heavyweights
1. Min Deletions to Make Frequency Unique (The most repeated question!)
2. String Without 3 Identical Consecutive Letters (No 'aaa' or 'bbb')
3. Lexicographically Smallest String (By removing one character)
4. Longest Substring Without 3 Contiguous Occurrences
5. Riddle: Replace '?' so no two adjacent chars are same.
6. Crop Words: Cut sentence to K chars (Don't chop words in half).
7. Min Swaps to Make Palindrome
8. Count Substrings with Unique Characters
9. Reverse Words in a String (With constraints)
10. Pattern Matching (KMP basics).

II. Arrays & Greedy Logic (The Tricky Ones)
11. Min Steps to Make Piles Equal Height
12. Fair Indexes: Split array into two equal sums.
13. Max Possible Value: Insert '5' to maximize result.
14. Largest K such that both K and -K exist.
15. Potholes: Fix max potholes with budget B.
16. Min Swaps to Group Red Balls
17. Max Inserts to obtain string without 'aaa'
18. Particle Velocity (Arithmetic slices).
19. Sign of the Product of an Array
20. Jump Game (Variations I, II, III).
